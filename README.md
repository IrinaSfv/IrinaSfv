# Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Irina!

I'm a highly motivated web developer. I dream of building performance applications that solve business problems and provide users with an awesome experience. My previous career as a UX writer allowed me to be communicative, creative and passionate about creating a good UX. 

Now Iâ€™m looking for a job as a front-end developer in a dream team.

## My principles:

* ðŸŽ“ I'm doing my best to achieve a high level of mastership. Now I'm actively working on my portfolio and spending a lot of time on self-education.

* ðŸ–‹ I try to write well-readable and clean code.
* ðŸ†• I'm eager to learn new frameworks and expand my tech stack
* ðŸ“Œ To reach my goals, I do:
  * Work on my own pet projects
  * Read professional books and watch educational videos. For example, now I've been reading the book "Grokking Algorithms" and watching video lectures of the CS50 course
  * Study at [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.com/) school and listen carefully to mentors and code reviewers
  <!-- * [I solve problems on CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/IreneSfv) -->
