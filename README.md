# Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Irina!

My goal is to build highly performant applications that solve business problems and provide users with an awesome experience. 
Now Iâ€™m looking for a job as a front-end developer in a dream team.

## My principles:

* ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to work in a dream team with exciting projects
* ðŸª„ I try to write well-readable and clean code
* ðŸ†• I'm eager to learn new frameworks and expand my tech stack
* ðŸ“Œ To reach my goals, I do:
  * Work on my pet projects
  * Listen to mentors and code reviewers on the [Yandex.Practicum platform](https://practicum.com/)
  <!-- * [I solve problems on CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/IreneSfv) -->
  * read professional books and watch educational videos. For example, now I've been reading the book "Grok algorithms" and watching video lectures of the CS50 course
  
## My current tech stack:
